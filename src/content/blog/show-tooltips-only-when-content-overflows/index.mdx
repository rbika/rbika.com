## Introduction

When dealing with dynamic data, content may not fit its container. A common solution is to truncate the text with ellipsis and display the full value in a tooltip on hover. However, tooltips are often displayed even when the text isn't truncated, which is unnecessary and distracting. Here's a quick tip on how to display the tooltip only when the text overflows its container.

See the live demo on [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/text-with-title-7cyt75?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%3A17%2C13).

## Explanation

To detect if text is overflowing, we can compare the `scrollWidth` and the `clientWidth` of the element:

- `scrollWidth` is the total width of the content inside the element
- `clientWidth` is the visible width of the element

If `scrollWidth` is greater than `clientWidth`, it means the content is overflowing horizontally.

With this, we can conditionally apply a title attribute (or show a custom tooltip) only when needed.
