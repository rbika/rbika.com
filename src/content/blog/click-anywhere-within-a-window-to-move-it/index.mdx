On macOS users can modify system settings using the `defaults` command. While most settings are available in the System Settings app, some can only be changed via the command line.

One of these hidden settings allows you to move windows by clicking anywhere inside them, rather than just the title bar. To enable it, open the terminal and run:

```bash frame="none"
defaults write -g NSWindowShouldDragOnGesture -bool true
```

For the changes to take effect for a specific app you may need to close it with `Cmd` + `Q`. To apply the setting system-wide, log out and log back in. Now, you can hold `Cmd` + `Ctrl` and click anywhere within a window to move it

To disable this behavior, just run:

```bash frame="none"
defaults write -g NSWindowShouldDragOnGesture -bool false
```
