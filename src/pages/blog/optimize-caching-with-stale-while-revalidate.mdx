## Introduction

The `stale-while-revalidate` directive is a powerful mechanism for improving user experience and application performance. Instead of making users wait for a slow response, it allows the browser or CDN to serve a stale, but still usable response immediately, while asynchronously revalidating the cache in the background. Once the validation is complete, the next requests will receive the updated cached response instantly.

## How does it work?

To use the `stale-while-revalidate` caching strategy, you need to include two directives in the `Cache-Control` header: `max-age`and`stale-while-revalidate`.

```bash
Cache-Control: max-age=X, slate-while-revalidate=Y
```

- `max-age=X` defines how long the cached response is considered fresh. If a request is made within this time (X seconds), the cached response is returned immediately without needing validation.
- `stale-while-revalidate=Y` defines how long a stale response can still be served while a background revalidation fetches a fresh response.

Let's take a look at some request scenarios.

For the examples below, we assume caching is handled by a CDN, and we use the following Cache-Control header:

```bash
Cache-Control: max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=60
```

#### 1. No Cache Available

If this is the first request, there is no cached response, so the data must be retrieved from the origin server.

<div className="flex justify-center items-center rounded-md bg-[#2f3340] px-2">
  <img
    src="/images/blog/optimize-caching-with-stale-while-revalidate/request-no-cache-expired-cache.svg"
    alt="Request with no cache steps"
  />
</div>

1. The client makes a request.
2. The CDN has no cached response, so it fetches the data from the server.
3. The CDN caches the response for future requests.
4. The client receives the response.

#### 2. Fresh Cache (within max-age)

If the cached response is less than 60 seconds old, it is considered fresh and returned immediately. No request to the server is made.

<div className="flex justify-center items-center rounded-md bg-[#2f3340] px-2">
  <img
    src="/images/blog/optimize-caching-with-stale-while-revalidate/request-fresh-cache.svg"
    alt="Request with fresh cache steps"
  />
</div>

1. The client makes a request.
2. The cached response is still fresh, so the CDN serves it immediately.

#### 3. Stale Cache but Still Valid (max-age expired, but within stale-while-revalidate)

If the cached response is older than 60 seconds but less than 120 seconds (60 < time < 120), it is considered stale but still valid. The stale response is served immediately, and in the background, the CDN fetches an updated response from the origin server.

<div className="flex justify-center items-center rounded-md bg-[#2f3340] px-2">
  <img
    src="/images/blog/optimize-caching-with-stale-while-revalidate/request-stale-cache.svg"
    alt="Request with stale cache steps"
  />
</div>

1. The client makes a request.
2. The stale response is immediately returned from the CDN.
3. A background request is sent to fetch an updated response.
4. The CDN updates its cache with the fresh response for future requests.

#### 4. Cache Expired (beyond max-age + stale-while-revalidate)

If the cached response is older than 120 seconds, it is no longer valid. The request must wait for a fresh response from the server before anything is returned. Avoiding this scenario as much as possible helps maintain better performance.

<div className="flex justify-center items-center rounded-md bg-[#2f3340] px-2">
  <img
    src="/images/blog/optimize-caching-with-stale-while-revalidate/request-no-cache-expired-cache.svg"
    alt="Request with expired cache steps"
  />
</div>

1. The client makes a request.
2. The cache is expired, so the CDN fetches data from the server.
3. The CDN updates its cache with the fresh response.
4. The client receives the response.

## Use cases

Here are two use cases that can benefit from stale-while-revalidate, along with possible configurations. Keep in mind that these values are just examples, and other options may also be suitable.

#### 1. Frequent updates, but slightly stale content is acceptable

**Goal**: Ensure fast page loads while reducing unnecessary API calls.

```bash
Cache-Control: max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=120
```

#### 2. Expensive requests that are frequently accessed

**Goal**: Deliver instant responses while ensuring data remains fresh.

```bash
Cache-Control: max-age=1, stale-while-revalidate=59
```

## Conclusion

The `stale-while-revalidate` directive ensures users rarely have to wait for a response, at the cost of occasionally serving slightly outdated data. It balances performance and freshness, improving page speed, user experience, and server efficiency.
