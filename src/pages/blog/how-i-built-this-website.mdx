Building something from scratch is one of the best ways to learn new skills and refine the ones you already have. This website is a side project I use to explore new technologies. Over time, it has gone through multiple versions with different stacks, and I'm constantly rebuilding and updating it to experiment with new frameworks and tools.

## Technology stack

For this iteration, I incorporated technologies I wanted to try but hadn't had the opportunity to use before. I also discovered and adopted some tools along the way. Here are the most notable ones:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A combination I've been using for a while and continue to enjoy.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework I had never worked with before but always heard good things about. My experience with it was excellent.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework. In my previous projects, I used Styled Components, but this time, I wanted to try something different. Even though I had to learn the class names on the go, I found Tailwind easy and efficient to work with.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) + [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): These are among the first tools I configure in any project to enforce code quality and consistent styling.
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/): Helps run tests, lints, and formatters using pre-commit hooks, allowing me to catch errors as early as possible.
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/): A React animation library I stumbled upon by accident. I was impressed by the range of effects it enables. So far, I'm using it to add fade-in/out transitions during page navigation.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) + [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/): My go-to tools for unit testing.
- [Unified](https://unifiedjs.com/): The blog posts are written in markdown and I use Unified along with plugins to convert them into HTML at build time.
- [Prismjs](https://prismjs.com/index.html): A syntax highlighter for code blocks.

And here are the services I'm using:

- [Github](https://github.com/): Where I host my personal projects.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): Provides easy and seamless deployments with GitHub integration.

## Design

The design and layout inspiration came from the websites of other developers like ([Kent C Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/), [Zeno Rocha](https://zenorocha.com/), and [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/)). For now, I'm using Tailwind [default color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#arbitrary-values), which looks great out of the box. The site also supports a light/dark theme that automatically adjusts based on the system's settings.

## Conclusion

I learned a lot while working on this project, and I plan to continue experimenting with it to explore new ideas and technologies. If you've never built something from scratch, I highly recommend giving it a try. You'll be surprised by how much you learn along the way.
