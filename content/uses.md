## Code Editor

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - I used Vim for many years but now I switched to VS Code. I use VS Code with the default theme (Dark+). Here are my [settings and keybindings](https://github.com/rbika/dotfiles-macos/tree/master/src/vscode).

## Terminal

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) - macOS Terminal replacement. Here is my [zsh config](https://github.com/rbika/dotfiles-macos/blob/master/src/zsh/.zshrc).
- [Dark+](https://github.com/rbika/iterm2-vscode-dark-plus) - I made a port from VS Code Dark+ theme to iTerm2.

## macOS apps

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) - Spotlight replacement.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - When I need to do some simple edits.
- [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) - Best Git client for macOS.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - My preferred browser.
- [Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/) - I switched from Spotify since I'm subscribed to the Apple One service.
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - Multi-platform note-taking app with markdown support.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) - macOS's window management is terrible.
